Researchers can also use these attacks to measure memorization in LMs. There are several different attack types with distinct attacker objectives. </p> <p>One of the most well-known attacks is Membership inference attacks (MIAs). MIAs determine whether a data point was included in the training data of the targeted model. Such attacks can result in various privacy breaches; for instance, discerning that a text sequence generated by Clinical LMs (trained on EHRs) originating from the training data can disclose sensitive patient information. </p> <p>At the simplest level, MIAs use the confidence of the target model on a target data instance to predict membership. A threshold is set against the confidence of the model to ascertain membership status. For a specific example, if the confidence is greater than the threshold then the attacker assumes the target is a member of the training data, as the model is \"unsurprised\" to see this example, indicating it has likely seen this example before during training. Currently, the most successful MIAs use reference models. This refers to a second model trained on a dataset similar to the training data of the target model. The reference model filters out uninteresting common examples, which will also be \"unsurprising\" to the reference model.</p>"},{"location":"articles/2024/04/11/privLM/#privacy-mitigations","title":"Privacy Mitigations","text":"<p>There are three primary approaches to mitigate privacy risks in LMs:</p> <ul> <li>Methods for data preprocessing - Data Sanitization aims to remove all sensitive information from data before the model aims to eliminate all sensitive information before model training. Data sanitization approaches are very effective when sensitive information follows a context-independent, consistent format (e.g., NHS numbers, email addresses, etc.). Still, they cannot guarantee the privacy of contextual text. Data Deduplication aims to remove duplicated sequences of text of a certain length in the dataset, leaving only one unique instance. This has been demonstrated to reduce overall memorization in large LMs. </li> <li>Training strategies include utilizing privacy-preserving learning algorithms, e.g., differentially private (DP) training - In DP training, during back propagation, the gradients for individual examples are clipped to a fixed norm, and noise is added to this before updating model parameters. This limits the effect that any one example can have on the model parameters, reducing the ability of the model to memorize the example. </li> <li>Post-training techniques such as Machine Unlearning or Editing - Machine Editing and Unlearning comprise a set of techniques for modifying or erasing information post-training, rendering them highly applicable in real-world scenarios. This could be used, for example, when somebody wishes to practice their Right-to-be-Forgotten, removing private data from the training data after model training. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/2024/04/11/privLM/#what-we-did","title":"What we did","text":"<p>In this project, we sought to understand more about the Privacy-Risk Landscape for Healthcare LMs and conduct a practical investigation of some existing privacy attacks and defensive methods.  </p> <p>Initially, we conducted a thorough literature search to understand the privacy risk landscape. Our first applied work package explored data deduplication before model training as a mitigation to reduce memorization and evaluated the approach with Membership Inference Attacks. We showed that RoBERTa models trained on patient notes are highly vulnerable to MIAs, even when only trained for a single epoch. We investigated data deduplication as a mitigation strategy but found that these models were just as vulnerable to MIAs. Further investigation of models trained for multiple epochs is needed to confirm these results. In the future, semantic deduplication could be a promising avenue for medical notes. </p> <p>Our second applied work package explored editing/unlearning approaches for healthcare LMs. Unlearning in LMs is poised to become increasingly relevant, especially in light of the growing awareness surrounding training data leakage and the 'Right to be Forgotten'. We found that many repositories for performing such approaches were not adapted for all LM types, and some are still not mature enough to be easy to use as packages. Exploring a Locate-then-Edit approach to Knowledge Neurons, we found this was not well suited to the erasure of information we needed in medical notes. Our findings suggest that the focus from a privacy perspective on these methods should be on those which allow the erasure of specific training data instances instead of relational facts. </p>"},{"location":"articles/2024/04/11/privLM/#where-next","title":"Where Next?","text":"<p>This work primarily explored privacy in pre-trained Masked Language Models. The growing adoption of generative LMs underscores the importance of expanding this work to Encoder and Encoder-Decoder models like the GPT family and T5. Also, due to the common practice of freezing parameters and tuning the last layer of a LM on a private dataset, it is critical to expand investigations of privacy risks to LMs fine-tuned on healthcare data. </p> <p>Within the scope of this exploration, the field of Machine Unlearning/Editing applied to LMs was in its infancy, but it is gaining momentum. As this field matures, comparing the efficacy of different methods becomes crucial. Furthermore, it is important to explore the effect of removing the influence of a set of data points. A holistic examination of the effectiveness, privacy implications, and broader impacts of Machine Unlearning/Editing methods on healthcare LMs is essential to inform the development of robust and privacy-conscious LMs in the NHS.</p> <p>When considering explainability of models, this often involves generating explanations or counterfactuals alongside the decisions made by the LM. However, integrating explanations into the output of LMs can introduce vulnerabilities related to training data leakage and privacy attacks. Additionally, efforts to enhance privacy, such as employing Privacy-preserving training techniques, can inadvertently impact fairness, particularly in datasets lacking diversity. In healthcare, all three elements are paramount, so investigating the privacy-explainability-fairness trade-off is crucial for developing private, robust and ethically sound LMs.</p> <p>Finally, privacy concerns in several emerging trends for LMs need to be understood in Healthcare scenarios. Incorporating external Knowledge Bases to enhance LMs, known as retrieval augmentation, could make LMs more likely to leak private information. Further, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), referring to LM-based models that can take in and reason over multimodal information common in healthcare, could be susceptible to leakage from one input modality through another output modality. </p>"},{"location":"articles/2024/07/08/annotation-tools/","title":"Investigating Annotation Tools for Named Entity Recognition","text":"<p>We have been building a proof-of-concept tool that scores the privacy risk of free text healthcare data.

This is true for many NER models, although some like Stanza (opens in new tab) from Stanford NLP Group (opens in new tab) and BERT (opens in new tab) token classifiers do not need an initial entity list for extraction. For our privacy tool to be effective, we want our list of entities to be representative of the real entities in the data, and not miss any important information.</p> <p></p> Figure 1: A frustrated user trying to extract entites!.  <p>Let's consider a new user who wants to investigate the privacy risk of a large unstructured dataset. Maybe they want to use this data to train a new generative healthcare model and don\u2019t want any identifiable information to leak into the training data. Or maybe this dataset is a large list of outputs from a similar model and they want to ensure that no identifiable information has found it's way into the data. They may ask:</p> <p>What does my data look like?</p> <p>What entities within my data have a high privacy risk?</p> <p>Wait a second, what even is an entity?</p> <p>We want to offer an easy and interactive starting point for new users of our tool, where they can easily explore their data, understand the role of NER and identify what risks lie in their data. If they miss certain entities, this could have large implications on the scoring aspect of our pipeline.</p> <p>Of course, we want people to use our tool efficiently and effectively!

As an example, a user can now use their cursor to highlight particular words and assign them an entity type which is more hands-on and engaging. Unlike our ipyWidgets example, users can select different labels to be displayed which makes the tool less cluttered, and you can easily navigate using a slider to separate reviews. Like the previous widget, there is a button which uses a NER model to label the text and give live feedback. Including this, the tool is more synergistic, easier to use and more immersive than the ipyWidgets alternative.</p> <p>However, there were still a few teething issues when developing the Streamlit app. Firstly, Streamlit annotation tool\u2019s has an inability to display <code>\\n</code> as a new line and instead prints <code>\\n</code>, resulting in the structure of text being lost. This is a Streamlit issue and we haven\u2019t yet found a way to keep the structure of the text intact. There was an easy fix in which each <code>\\n</code> was replaced with two spaces (this means the start and end character count for each labelled entity remains consistent with the original structured text), but the structure of the text is still lost which may cause issues for some future users.</p> <p>Secondly, Streamlit involves a little bit more set up than ipyWidgets. Rather than interacting with the reviews in your notebook you run the app on a local port and access it through your browser. This also makes it harder to retrieve back into your pipeline the list of entities you have labelled.

Having use cases meant that it was so much easier to split work up, and get our heads down, with everyone having something to actively work on. It also meant we had a structured approach, making the experience so much more fulfilling. I was delighted by the creativity and range of approaches that the different teams took when it came to presenting at the end of the two days. We ranged from teams that had taken a thin slice approach to all three usecases, to teams that had gone really in depth in just one of them, to teams that had taken use case number three and made it into a tool that could be used by the websites team to improve the websites on the backend, removing conflict and duplication. </p> <p>Overall, I was left in awe by the creativity and technical skills of our team, as well as of all the other attendees. Hopefully the work gets used in the future by the websites team, and I hope that any hackathons I attend in the future are of this high quality! (Of course it did help that my team won)</p> <p></p> <p>The final results were: </p> <p>First Place: A thin slice approach of all three usecases, a project which included 4 of our very own data scientists: Sean Aller, Sudeshna Mallik, Xiyao Zhuang, and myself, as well as Rob Mansfield, Veta Ngammekchay, and our wonderful Kainos helper Peter Bodnar. </p> <p>Second Place: Data Scientists Chaeyoon Kim and Warren Davis, with Mary Amanuel, Piyali Dutta, and Farwah Kazmi from elsewhere in the NHS, together with Microsoft's Dan Watkinson and Josh Mercurio developed an AI career coach that was able to draw from and cite relevant information from the HEE website, and was easily customisable to improve communication towards different user personas.</p> <p>Third Place: Contradiction Finder by Data Science's Ben Wallace, Matt Taylor, and Jenny Chim, as well as Andrew Walker and Microsoft's Hannah Howell and Hanna Riaz. Focused on use case 3, making a usable tool for the websites team to find contraditions. </p> <p></p> <p>Quotes from some of the attendees about their experience: </p> <p>Bashir Abubakar</p> <p>The hackathon was an incredible experience that not only allowed me to learn how to use Azure AI Foundry but also deepened my understanding of how large language models (LLMs) can transform healthcare, particularly within the NHS. My fascination with transformers began when I first read Attention is All You Need paper, which revolutionised the NLP space with its groundbreaking approach to self-attention. Seeing this theory in action, from research papers to practical applications, has been nothing short of inspiring. The hackathon felt like a full-circle moment, as it opened new pathways for applying LLMs in healthcare, a vision I\u2019ve long held for the future of AI professionals (Industry 4.0). It also reinforced the transformative role of prompt engineering, a skill I believe is pivotal in unlocking the potential of AI in creating meaningful solutions. </p> <p>Will Poulett:</p> <p>The variety of professions within each team was great, it's not often that GP's and data scientists can work together using generative AI.

At this stage in the neural network, the model had already identified patterns and similarities between classes, which we could visualise as clusters in the plot, with similar images appearing closer together.</p> <p>We picked out five different dimension reduction techniques for our tool: TSNE, PCA, Feature Agglomeration, Isomap and Umap.

We were successful in using generative AI to turn a list of scenarios into an image dataset. However, there were lots of manual steps involved in doing so. Ideally, this tool can be turned into a semi-autonomous pipeline where humans check intermediate steps but have less of a need to edit them or clean LLM outputs. </p> <p>We don't want users to have to remove random tokens written in another language every time they use the tool!</p> <p>Does an interactive tool make evaluating AI classifiers easier?</p> <p>This again seems to be successful. Assurers without much knowledge of AI systems were able to identify images and risks, whilst suggesting additional images they\u2019d like to generate and evaluate.</p> <p>Do image labels improve the tool?</p> <p>This is harder to measure. An ideal answer would be no, as this tool could be used without the time-consuming labelling step, whilst still being useful for evaluations. Whilst there are indications of this, we don\u2019t have enough information to come to a strong conclusion.</p> <p>Does knowing the model\u2019s prediction change how evaluators interpret the results?</p> <p>Again, this is hard to measure. The differences between seeing the model prediction and not seeing the model prediction when using the labelling tool is small. We likely need to run a larger experiment in order to get more statistically significant results.</p> <p>Adding an additional comment, we also gained very little evidence of assurers using hybrid animal pictures to make conclusions about the behaviour of the model. This doesn\u2019t suggest that AI generated images aren\u2019t useful for evaluation, more that our 'guess' of what an 'edge-case' image is, doesn\u2019t line up with the model\u2019s decision boundary.</p>"},{"location":"articles/2024/12/12/RISE_tool/#whats-next","title":"What's next?","text":"<p>So, what next?

What did you do before, and what really sparked your interest in this field?","text":"<p>My journey to data science at the NHS is a blend of engineering roots, a pandemic pivot, and a strong personal connection to healthcare.</p> <p>My academic background began with an Integrated Master's in Aerospace Engineering. I was captivated by the problem-solving inherent in understanding how complex systems, particularly aircraft, function. This fascination with engineering persists, as evidenced by my continued interest in aerospace content.</p> <p>A pivotal moment that hinted at my future direction occurred during a second-year Business Simulation module. We were tasked with managing car companies within a simulated European market. I developed a comprehensive spreadsheet to optimise production, enabling us to create cost-effective cars with popular features. I would go on to make many more spreadsheets, including one that calculated my mark margins for upcoming exams to allow me to still graduate with first class honours.</p> <p>Following graduation, I joined a small engineering firm, where I contributed to the development of control software for automated test rigs. We built custom rigs to test components like aircraft actuators and truck brake assemblies, using the visual programming language LabVIEW. This involved wiring code sections together, and I still recognise LabVIEW's distinctive interface in various applications, including airport airbridge controls.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I lost my job around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, coinciding with a severe contraction of the job market. During the lockdown, I used the time to learn Python, which sparked a realisation that I wanted to pursue a career in data science. While I'd always enjoyed numbers, spreadsheets, problem-solving, and programming, the pandemic provided the catalyst to connect these interests.</p> <p>I enrolled in a Data Science conversion Master's program at Loughborough University, joining the inaugural cohort of the degree. The decision to apply to the NHS was deeply personal. My father was a GP and healthcare consultant, and my then-girlfriend (now wife), was training to be a doctor. The NHS's mission resonated with me, and I discovered the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme. I applied and was fortunate enough to be accepted.</p> <p>I began my role at the NHS just two weeks after submitting my Master's project.</p>"},{"location":"articles/2025/04/16/interview_with_joseph_wilson/#once-you-joined-the-nhs-what-was-that-experience-like-what-different-roles-and-teams-have-you-been-a-part-of-and-how-have-they-shaped-your-career","title":"Once you joined the NHS, what was that experience like?

I've been here for three years now, starting at NHS Digital and then transitioning into NHS England after the merger. My first two years were spent on the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme, and since then, I've been working as a full-fledged Data Scientist.</p> <p>That Graduate Scheme was incredible. We were the first cohort of its kind, a group of just under twenty, and we kicked things off with an intense eight-week coding bootcamp. It was a fantastic bonding experience \u2013 we'd be hammering away at code and then decompressing with board games during breaks.</p> <p>My first placement on the NHS Spine project, which is this massive, intricate system connecting all sorts of different NHS systems. Because it's so complex, everyone was constantly learning, and that made it a really supportive environment for a newbie like me. Plus, I got to see firsthand what a well-oiled DevOps team looked like, which really shaped my approach moving forward, especially when I landed in the Business Intelligence Development Team.</p> <p>That team was all about building Tableau dashboards and trying to standardise things. My manager asked me to dig into the Tableau API. They had this super slow, manual process for checking dashboards, and I realised we could automate it with Python. So, I built a proof-of-concept testing framework, which was a great chance to put my NHS Spine lessons to work in a totally different area.</p> <p>My final placement was with the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) Squad. We were all about promoting good coding practices for analytics and helping teams automate their workflows. Basically, we were bringing in the best of data and software engineering into the data science and analytics space. In that role, I got to write articles, create training guides, and even run workshops. We also did these 'Engagements' with other analytical teams, helping them improve their processes. After a year, I passed my end-of-scheme interview and got promoted to a Band 7 Data Scientist, staying with the RAP Squad and leading those Engagements.</p> <p>More recently, I moved to the National Secure Data Environment Service Team, or the SDE Data Wranglers. We make sure researchers get the right, pseudonymised data. While there, I also got to work on a side project developing an ML-powered tool to detect potentially sensitive information in huge datasets. It was a fun challenge, working with Docker containers, PySpark, and figuring out how to deploy ML models in a clustered computing environment.</p> <p>Overall, it's been a really varied and rewarding experience. Each role has built on the last, and I've learned so much about the NHS and the power of data.</p>"},{"location":"articles/2025/04/16/interview_with_joseph_wilson/#what-are-you-currently-working-on-are-there-any-projects-that-youre-particularly-excited-about-or-that-you-feel-are-making-a-real-difference-what-impact-are-you-having","title":"What are you currently working on?

We've managed to cut the processing time from a week down to just a few minutes, which is a huge win! It's incredibly rewarding to free up my colleagues' time, allowing them to focus on more impactful, data-driven insights rather than repetitive tasks.</p> <p>I'm also personally driven to achieve something new for me; building a pipeline that meets Gold RAP compliance standard; essentially, a fully automated and packaged analytical process.

Think to yourself, 'Can I explain what I'm doing to a 9-year-old in a way that they would not only understand but also find captivating?' Channel your inner kids' TV presenter or science journalist!</p> <p>A great way to achieve this is by using everyday analogies. Try comparing a project, process, or problem to a familiar, everyday situation. Recently, when explaining technical concepts, I've used examples like visiting a restaurant or using an iPhone.</p> <p>If you can help people, feel intelligent (rather than prioritising making yourself appear intelligent!), they are far more likely to engage with and remember what you're trying to convey.</p> <p>It's natural, after completing a complex piece of work, to want to highlight its difficulty and intricacy. While sometimes this is necessary, generally, strive to find common ground and make the concepts accessible.</p> <p>Secondly, ensure you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of the data science technique or approach you're using, including its potential weaknesses as well as its strengths compared to other methods.</p> <p>In an age where we can execute complicated processes and code with a few clicks, it's not always mandatory to delve into the underlying statistical models. However, to build your own confidence and effectively explain your work to others, this understanding of the fundamentals is, for me, paramount. It also equips you to critically evaluate the next 'new big thing' that emerges. Aim to be a cynical optimist in your approach. </p> <p>We hope you found this interview with Sarah Culkin insightful.

I now feel like I have a comprehensive set of notes I can refer to if I'm ever in doubt about which technique is most appropriate, or how to improve a particular model. The project phase I found really challenging, particularly at the beginning, because I really struggled to figure out how to come up with a project that would be impactful, reusable, and allow me to practice as many of my new skills as possible.

When I was asked what I wanted to be at age 11 I said \u201ca maths teacher\u201d, which felt a bit out of step with the dreams of astronauts and footballers around me. That early love for numbers truly set the stage for my academic and professional life.</p> <p>Fast forward to being 16, and I stumbled upon the existence of an Astrophysics degree. From that moment, that became the goal. I've always loved to describe astrophysics as \"just maths with pretty pictures\", and honestly, what's not to love about that combination? In 2018, fresh out of school, I embarked on a Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology MPhys at Lancaster University. My Masters project involved a deep dive into a dataset of 40,000 galaxies, performing extensive classification and statistical analysis. However, my very first taste of what I now recognise as data science techniques came during an internship at The University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy. There, I used Markov-Chain Monte Carlo modelling to understand the shapes and densities of debris and dust around exoplanets, which even led to this published paper.</p> <p></p> <p>Nearing the end of my university studies, a significant realisation dawned on me: despite my enthusiasm for my degree and for astrophysics as a whole, I just wanted to contribute to something that had a tangible impact in the \"real world\". So, I dove into the job market, applying to almost every role that claimed to welcome physics graduates, though with limited success. It was during a moment of frustration that my mum suggested: \"Amaia, you love understanding complicated topics through reading and making graphs, why don't you look for jobs where you can do that?\"</p> <p>That simple question was a revelation. It completely shifted my perspective, and I began searching for data-focused roles. That's how I discovered the NHS Digital graduate scheme. It felt like the perfect alignment \u2013 an opportunity to explore a data career within a broader technical scheme, which meant I wasn't locked into a single path.

It quickly became clear that this wasn't my forte; I wasn't very good at it, nor did I truly enjoy it. After spending a year at the NHS, observing my fellow grad, Will, creating \"cool plots\" for the CVD Pathways project, I decided that the team that he was in might be a good match.

Don't pursue data science simply because it's a popular or trendy field with growing job opportunities. Instead, figure out what truly brings you joy, be it coding, maths, creating visualisations, or anything else, and then explore how that passion aligns with the role of a data scientist.

I didn't get onto the scientist training programme unfortunately, so the first proper job I got after uni was at \"the NHS Information Centre\" (NHSIC) as a Band 5 Data Engineer (though back then they were called \"Information Analysts\", oddly) in the reference data team. I'll be honest, I kind of blagged my interview as my SQL knowledge was not great (they didn't care about Python!), but I was a quick learner and soon was helping contribute and improve things. Automating the processes that brought reference data files into a corporate database wasn't glamorous, but it was impactful, and I learnt so much about production products, working with people who felt you were threatening their job, and crucially, helping them see the opportunities this type of automation can bring. I got promoted to Band 6 after one year, then after another year I felt the itch to return to academia, so I embarked on my PhD.</p> <p>I did a four-year Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, eventually focussing on studying how doping a type of bioactive glass-ceramic with Strontium made it \"osteoinductive\". I did do proper cell biology work in a lab (and got to see a whole room of sawn-in-half cadavers), but the part I enjoyed most was the big data analysis of the genomics experiments I did, and again, helping my biology colleagues write programmes to automate some of their repetitive image processing. </p> <p>At the end of the PhD I was a bit burnt out from research, so I came back to my old team as a Band 7 Data Engineer in the NHSIC (now called the HSCIC, which later became NHS Digital) where Python was now in vogue. I really learnt a lot about how to programme professionally - code version control, tests, pulling data down from Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), dev, test, live, the works! I then got made redundant, and through the internal process to find me a new job I got reallocated to the data science team in London! </p> <p>Over the next five years, I established myself as a data scientist, getting promoted to Band 8a and working on a number of different projects - COVID patient forecasting, helping set up the Trusted Research Environment (TRE) - I was the original TRE Data Wrangler in the business! - and spending almost three years spreading Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) alongside a great number of incredible colleagues.</p> <p>The final chapter of my career here was moving to Data Architecture where I continued the legacy of the RAP work, establishing coding and data standards in the business.</p>"},{"location":"articles/2025/10/31/interview_with_sam_hollings/#what-are-you-currently-working-on-are-there-any-projects-that-youre-particularly-excited-about-or-that-you-feel-are-making-a-real-difference-what-impact-are-you-having","title":"What are you currently working on?

You can see our prototype here! Many people in the business write the same old code... like how there are 20-something different algorithms for NHS number validation. We just need ONE - agreed, made to a high standard, signed off, and easy to consume. Alongside this, I've been working with others to clarify open sourcing, code documentation, code metadata, and reusable code standards, so it's easier for our colleagues to adopt best practice.</p> <p>Alongside this, I've led the work on establishing some Data Principles for NHS England. These are basic statements, often quite obvious, that act as a guiding light for how we use data. Ours are not published yet, but a great example is the data principles released by the ONS.</p> <p>I also spent a while doing work on LLMs and other AI tools, including going to work for Downing Street for two months on an AI taskforce building a RAG-based tool for the Deputy Prime Minister. I tried to bring this learning back and share it with our colleagues through this interactive notebook: https://github.com/SamHollings/llm_tutorial</p> <p>Probably the project I'm most well known for is \"Reproducible Analytical Pipelines\" (RAP). I really rode on the coat-tails of others, with colleagues such as Connor Quinn and Helen Richardson really getting it going in NHS Digital. My team and I focussed on helping people and making RAP interesting and fun, such as by having Christmas-themed sets of posts about RAP, and by challenging ourselves to mention it in nearly every meeting, including All Hands Calls! We trained a number of teams, who themselves went on to train others, so probably hundreds of analysts benefited from our work, and this isn't even counting the teams from other organisations in London, Canada, France, and elsewhere who adopted our guidance! This work was really rewarding as it genuinely helped our colleagues. We managed to help colleagues reduce some pieces of work that took two people two weeks to run, to only take one person 40 minutes! We also tracked the success of the programme by measuring how many teams had reached baseline, silver, and gold RAP, and tracking how this changed each month, focussing our efforts on where people were getting stuck.</p> <p>In terms of communication, I'm a big fan of using humour to make even the driest subject interesting. You have to use it sparingly, but when used at the right point, it can really help you hammer home the points you're trying to make. I also use a lot of metaphors, describing technical things in terms of chocolate bars, cakes, vehicles - anything which allows me to get the core idea across in a way people can understand, and that feels real to them.</p>"},{"location":"articles/2025/10/31/interview_with_sam_hollings/#if-you-could-give-someone-just-starting-out-in-data-science-a-few-pieces-of-advice-what-would-they-be-and-what-resources-have-you-found-particularly-helpful-along-the-way-that-you-can-share","title":"If you could give someone just starting out in data science a few pieces of advice, what would they be?

Process mining provides a rich set of methods to analyse a series of events that make up a patient pathway.

In addition, there is often limited capacity of data producers to provide data.

In this study, we use machine learning to predict cancer diagnosis in the next year. We select nine cancer sites with high incidence of late-stage diagnosis or worsening survival rates, and where there are currently no national screening programmes. We use National Health Service (NHS) data from medical helplines (NHS 111) and secondary care appointments from all hospitals in England. We show that features based on information captured in NHS 111 calls are among the most influential in driving predictions of a future cancer diagnosis. Our predictive models exhibit good discrimination (AUC \u2013 0.78 \u2013 SD 0.04), ranging from 0.69 (ovarian cancer) to 0.83 (oesophageal cancer). While our predictive modelling provides patient level risk predictions, our emphasis is on constructing cohorts of patients who may be at risk of cancer rather than individual risk scores. We present an approach of constructing cohorts at higher risk of cancer based on feature importance and considering possible bias in model results. These outputs can be used to develop highly targeted case finding services, which could help increase earlier detection rates and reduce health disparities. This approach is flexible and can be tailored based on the group the intervention targets (i.e. symptomatic or asymptomatic patients) and the data available to those charged with administering the intervention.</p> <p>[8] https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13978</p> <p>Medisure: Towards Assuring Machine Learning-Based Medical Image Classifiers Using Mixup Boundary Analysis</p> <p>Adam Byfield, William Poulett, Ben Wallace, Anusha Jose, Shatakshi Tyagi, Smita Shembekar, Adnan Qayyum, Junaid Qadir, Muhammad Bilal</p> <p>Machine learning (ML) models are becoming integral in healthcare technologies, necessitating formal assurance methods to ensure their safety, fairness, robustness, and trustworthiness. However, these models are inherently error-prone, posing risks to patient health and potentially causing irreparable harm when deployed in clinics. Traditional software assurance techniques, designed for fixed code, are not directly applicable to ML models, which adapt and learn from curated datasets during training. Thus, there is an urgent need to adapt established software assurance principles such as boundary testing with synthetic data. To bridge this gap and enable objective assessment of ML models in real-world clinical settings, we propose Mix-Up Boundary Analysis (MUBA), a novel technique facilitating the evaluation of image classifiers in terms of prediction fairness. We evaluated MUBA using brain tumour and breast cancer classification tasks and achieved promising results. This research underscores the importance of adapting traditional assurance principles to assess ML models, ultimately enhancing the safety and reliability of healthcare technologies.

We explore specialized pre-training to adapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are assessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training objective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings. These schemes are evaluated on downstream document classification tasks for each dataset, with additional analysis of the resultant embedding spaces. Contrastively trained models outperform other approaches on the classification tasks, delivering strong performance from limited labeled data and with fewer model parameter updates required. While metadata-based pre-training does not further improve classifications across the datasets, it yields interesting embedding cluster separability. All domain adapted LLMs outperform their publicly available general base LLM, validating the importance of domain-specialization. This research illustrates efficient approaches to instill healthcare competency in compact LLMs even under tight computational budgets, an essential capability for responsible and sustainable deployment in local healthcare settings. We provide pre-training guidelines for specialized healthcare LLMs, motivate continued inquiry into contrastive objectives, and demonstrates adaptation techniques to align small LLMs with privacy-sensitive medical tasks.</p> <p>[5] https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-56107-8_21 - Conference Paper</p> <p>Hypergraphs for Frailty Analysis Research Paper</p> <p>Zoe Hancox, Samuel D.

SHAP calculates the contribution of each variable to the model predicted probability output. The red colour indicates higher values for the selected feature, and a positive SHAP value means an increase in the risk of cancer. For example, higher age (red colour) has overwhelmingly positive SHAP values, which means that higher age is predicting higher risk of bladder cancer in the next year. </p> <p></p> <p>We observe that beyond age and gender, several comorbidities appear as relevant predictors of a bladder cancer diagnosis in ways that are consistent with expectations based on the medical literature. For example, the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and urinary infections is associated with the incidence of bladder cancer in previous research.</p> <p>In addition, several features drawn from the NHS 111 calls dataset appear to be good predictors of bladder cancer incidence. For example, higher number of calls to NHS 111 lines reporting cancer related symptoms is one of the features with the highest gain metric value (just below demographics and long-term condition status). In addition, we also see that features capturing specific symptoms that are plausibly related to undiagnosed bladder cancer are also relevant and have the expected direction of effect. Specifically, higher number of calls to NHS 111 lines reporting \u201cpain and frequency of passing urine\u201d or \u201cblood in urine\u201d (during the last year) are both relevant predictors of risk of being diagnosed with bladder cancer in the next year. </p>","tags":["POPULATION HEALTH","RAP","MACHINE LEARNING","PYTHON","STRUCTURED DATA","WIP"]},{"location":"our_work/cancer_high_risk_cohorts/#cohort-construction","title":"Cohort construction","text":"<p>We select relevant features based on feature importance and data availability.

This method has been applied to the whole population, and to sub-groups of demographic strata, demonstrating how the approach can be used for targeted screening, as shown in the figure below. </p> <p></p> <p>In the table below, we show  examples of such curated cohorts based on combinations of just two features among those that the model considers as high importance for predicting cancer incidence in the next year. We define a lift value as the ratio of the cancer incidence within the cohort to the baseline cancer incidence.

Applying these flags to the population results in a cohort size of approximately 100,000 individuals, with a cancer rate 6 times higher than in the overall study population. An example of a larger cohort of ~290,000 individuals would be constructed by applying the filter of patients having at least one long-term condition, and a diagnosis relating to symptoms and signs involving the genitourinary system in the last 5 years.

For example, the SHAP feature importance plots show that higher age, male, and white ethnicity all tend to increase the model risk score. This does correspond with higher incidence of bladder cancer in this group, however, given the low counts of bladder cancer among other demographic groups, it is difficult to ensure fair representation of all strata when constructing high-risk cohorts. </p> <p>We sought to mitigate this by segmenting the population into demographic groups to investigate if different sets of features can create higher risk cohorts across demographic strata. The segmentation was based on gender (male/female) and broad ethnicity (White/Non-white), resulting in four groups. Due to the low incidence of bladder cancer, more granular segmentation would have resulted in very small sample sizes. For each population segment, the same methodology as described above was applied, with the cohort with the highest incidence of cancer cases being identified. These decision rules were then applied to the test dataset to evaluate the efficacy of the cohort. The lift value was calculated based on the incidence of cancer for each stratum. </p> Demographic strata Feature combination Cohort size Incidence in cohort (%) Lift value Female \u2013 non white ethnicity At least 1 A&amp;E attendance in the last year AND diagnosis of a long term condition 195000 0.01% 2.9 Female \u2013 white ethnicity At least one call reporting cancer related symptoms in last year AND at least one call reporting blood in urine in last year 6800 0.8% 47.5 Male \u2013 non white ethnicity At least 1 A&amp;E attendance in the last year AND diagnosis of COPD 7000 0.07% 4.9 Male \u2013white ethnicity At least one call reporting cancer related symptoms in last year AND at least one call reporting blood in urine in last year 7600 1.9% 36 <p>For the white ethnicity group, features related to 111 calls are particularly effective in identifying high-risk groups. The specific nature of the symptom information (blood in urine) can result in small cohorts with lift values of 47.5 for white females, and 36 for white males. In contrast, for the non-white ethnic group, more general health factors (e.g. A&amp;E attendance) and comorbidities (e.g. COPD) result in the highest risk groups. These cohorts are still significantly higher in cancer incidence compared to baseline rates for these populations, as shown by the lift values of 2.9 for females, and 4.9 for males. However, they are also significantly lower than the lift values obtained for the white ethnic group. This likely reflects health inequalities in the utilisation of services such as 111 calls. </p>","tags":["POPULATION HEALTH","RAP","MACHINE LEARNING","PYTHON","STRUCTURED DATA","WIP"]},{"location":"our_work/cancer_high_risk_cohorts/#teams","title":"Teams","text":"<p>This project is a collaboration between the NHS England Data Science, Strategic Analysis and Cancer Programme teams.</p>","tags":["POPULATION HEALTH","RAP","MACHINE LEARNING","PYTHON","STRUCTURED DATA","WIP"]},{"location":"our_work/cancer_high_risk_cohorts/#links","title":"Links","text":"Output Link Constructing multicancer risk cohorts using national data from medical helplines and secondary care Published paper (npj Digital Medicine) Data Processing pipeline Github Presentation at Health and Care Analytics Conference 2024 YouTube Presentation at RPYSOC Conference 2024 Youtube","tags":["POPULATION HEALTH","RAP","MACHINE LEARNING","PYTHON","STRUCTURED DATA","WIP"]},{"location":"our_work/cancer_high_risk_cohorts/#_1","title":"Cancer high-risk cohorts","text":"","tags":["POPULATION HEALTH","RAP","MACHINE LEARNING","PYTHON","STRUCTURED DATA","WIP"]},{"location":"our_work/casestudy-recruitment-shortlisting/","title":"Examining whether recruitment data can, and should, be used to train AI models for shortlisting interview candidates","text":"","tags":["WORKFORCE","NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING","LLM","NEURAL NETWORKS","RESEARCH","SYNTHETIC DATA","STRUCTURED DATA","PYTHON","COMPLETE"]},{"location":"our_work/casestudy-recruitment-shortlisting/#info","title":"Info","text":"<p>This is a backup of the case study published here on the NHS England Transformation Directorate website.</p>","tags":["WORKFORCE","NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING","LLM","NEURAL NETWORKS","RESEARCH","SYNTHETIC DATA","STRUCTURED DATA","PYTHON","COMPLETE"]},{"location":"our_work/casestudy-recruitment-shortlisting/#case-study","title":"Case Study","text":"<p>Recruitment is a complex process where many factors need to be considered and understood so that the right candidates can be shortlisted for an interview.

Each ward at a hospital has a maximum student hosting capacity, and this can vary depending on the student\u2019s current year of study. Wards must also keep to internal Education Audit Standards to ensure they can provide necessary support to students, and this must be checked regularly.</p> <p>When these requirements are combined with the fact that Trusts can have relationships with multiple universities, placing students at tens of wards at a time, it is clear such complex schedules could be time consuming for a placement coordinator to produce.

Imperial hosts students from seven universities, placing them across three hospitals, totalling more than 80 wards and placement settings. Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust is one the largest acute trusts in the UK (according to the Kings Fund), so would provide substantial evidence as to whether this solution was viable. The data used was anonymised as this task could be undertaken without needing to provide any details on a personal level. Instead, information about the hospitals were taken, and randomly generated student profiles were created containing examples of the information the Trust would have about each student.</p> <p>The task posed here is one of optimisation, of which there are many different approaches. The method selected was a Genetic Algorithm, where the best version of something is found through a process which is like the evolutionary process seen in nature. The algorithm runs as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a population of objects (in this case, it was a population of potential schedules for all students)</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply \u2018mutations\u2019 and produce \u2018offspring\u2019 from this population of objects</p> </li> <li>Mutations were produced by randomly changing the allocated ward for a random placement</li> <li> <p>Offspring were produced by combining schedules e.g. taking the front half of one schedule, and the back half of another schedule and sticking them together to produce a hybrid</p> </li> <li> <p>Put the \u2018mutated\u2019 and \u2018offspring\u2019 objects back into the population, and score the population</p> </li> <li> <p>The scoring part is key, as this is what dictates what a \u2018good\u2019 schedule looks like. This is where you define what absolutely cannot be in a schedule, and what you\u2019d like a good schedule to have</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat the process hundreds of times until you have found a schedule which meets all your needs.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>A diagram showing how the genetic algorithm works.</p> <p>Genetic Algorithms will not produce a perfect, optimal solution as the way the problem space is explored is random. This means, while all your requirements will be met, the most varied selection of placements might not be found because it would take too long for the Genetic Algorithm to find that solution. However, a more varied selection of placements will be allocated than at the beginning, or if the process was carried out with the current, manual process.</p> <p>The chosen approach was to use such a Genetic Algorithm, run multiple times to produce multiple different schedule options, which are then presented back to the placement coordinator for them to cast their expert eye over and choose the best option. Alongside the schedules themselves, the scores which the Genetic Algorithm uses can be presented so that different schedules can be compared to each other. Further, this score can be broken down into components, so the exact strengths and weaknesses of each schedule can be seen, allowing the placement coordinator to evaluate which suits their Trust and its students.</p>","tags":["SECONDARY CARE","WORKFORCE","MACHINE LEARNING","SIMULATION","MODELLING","PSEUDONYMISED","PYTHON","COMPLETE","EXPERIMENTAL"]},{"location":"our_work/nursing-placement-optimisation/#deciding-how-to-score-schedules","title":"Deciding how to score schedules","text":"<p>The scoring of schedules is arguably the most important part of a Genetic Algorithm because it defines what a \u2018good\u2019 schedule and \u2018bad\u2019 schedule might look like.

In the current process, the placement coordinator would ensure any schedule produced meets these criteria:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Each ward and placement setting does not have more students allocated than their capacity allows. This includes both overall and for each year group. Year groups have different capacities because each year requires a different level of support and management.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any ward a student is placed on is aligned to the student\u2019s COVID risk level.

Similar to the previous point, this feels like an obvious criteria, but must be enforced to make sure the final schedule produced is useful.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Meanwhile, nice-to-have scoring components focus more on trying to ensure diversity of placements.

The online environment recommended by OpenSAFELY is Gitpod, which provides 50 free hours of monthly usage and negates the need for any software other than that required for accessing the TPP server. The Gitpod environment is easy to set up and integrates well with GitHub.</li> <li>If higher levels of monthly usage are envisaged, which may particularly be the case during the more time intensive co-piloting period, it may be preferable to have the required software downloaded locally.

This software is not part of the standard set up for NHS England laptops, and higher levels of permissions (e.g. a developer account) are required to install it.

This provided a fast, effective and secure method for working on the code locally.</p> <p>Code for all OpenSAFELY projects (regardless of the setup) is stored on GitHub, a website designed for storing and collaborating on code. Instructions for setting up a GitHub account and preparing the necessary computing environment for completion of the project can be found in the OpenSAFELY Getting Started Guide.</p> <p>Another key component to the technical set up (regardless of whether Gitpod or local set up is used) is installing the software required to access the TPP server. This is needed to view the results when the analysis code has been run on real data. This is done by connecting to the TPP VPN. Unfortunately, due to the specific settings for the VPN, it was not possible to connect to the VPN via a cloud-based virtual machine.

This code is known as the study definition. In addition to allowing time for resolving technology and set up issues, it is also important to be aware that creating the code, particularly for the study definition, is an iterative process. It is beneficial to clearly define the study population and the variables of interest at the start of the project with the co-pilot, as it may take several iterations to correctly code the method for extracting the study cohort. Care should also be taken to ensure that key demographics align with NHS standards and that definitions within the study definition are applied correctly.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Examples of issues which require careful consideration and clarification include: the correct manner for extracting demographic variables, the appropriate inclusion criteria (i.e. what data needed to be present for a patient to be included in the study), issues relating to redaction of small numbers and rounding principles.

Co-pilots may be able to assist with functions which can apply redacting and rounding automatically, but careful consideration must be given to exactly what redaction and rounding is required in each scenario.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Many variables are extracted based on a codelist (a collection of clinical codes that classifies patients as having certain conditions or demographic properties \u2013 code systems include SNOMED and CTV3).

The project team are responsible for use of codelists and it is important to ensure that codelists used are appropriate for the purpose. Clinical or other expert input may be required to ensure this.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Currently, for studies looking at multiple time periods, separate cohorts are extracted for each of the relevant time periods (e.g. one week or one month). For this project separate cohorts were extracted for each week over the time period from April 2019 to June 2022. This can result in the project taking significant time to run in the server. One way to reduce this workload is to put any variables which do not change significantly over time into a \u2018static\u2019 study definition and run this cohort extraction only once.

OpenSAFELY provide the means to create fake data, which can be used to test the code prior to running on real data, however the return expectations for the fake data (what it is expected to look like) must be defined by the researcher and this can lead to a mismatch in the format of the fake data compared to the real data.

Discovery is the most common process mining investigation, where the discovered process model is often not expected by the supervisor of the process. In conformance checking we measure how well the recorded processes fits a pre-defined process model.

Data scientists will often work as part of a multidisciplinary team, using data and analytics to inform and achieve organisational goals.</p> <p>Data scientists will often use programming languages such as Python and R (among others!) to solve problems within a business or to inform decisions, working with other colleagues such as analysts and data engineers.</p> <p>Some examples of the kinds of problems data science can help with are:</p> <ul> <li>Getting more value out of unstructured data (e.g. text, images, audio) through \"Natural Language Processing\", \"Neural Networks\" and recently \"Large Language Models\" (e.g. ChatGPT).</li> <li>Modelling systems and forecasting (though compared with statisticians and economists, this tends to be more empirical, requiring more focus on evaluation).</li> <li>Explaining existing models and their performance - communication is a key pillar of data science: making the complex understandable to everyone else.</li> <li>Enriching and transforming data, such as through linkage, feature engineering, artificial and synthetic data generation.</li> <li>Classification and regression - that is saying what something is, or if something will or won't happen, and/or quantifying something unknown.</li> </ul> <p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are techniques which are widely associated with data science and data scientists, and which can be applied to basically any of the problems listed above. See also this article on the \"Seven Patterns of AI\".</p> How do data scientists differ from analysts and data engineers? <p>Data science can be quite hard to pin down, as it covers a lot of different techniques, and problems, and data scientists themselves often have a lot of overlap with analysts and data engineers. Analysts and engineers might well use data science techniques in their work!</p> <p>However, generally data scientists are more focused on looking ahead, embracing and exploiting new techniques across a range of different types of data, e.g. unstructured data, such as text, images, audio.</p>"},{"location":"what_is_data_science/Benefits%20of%20Data%20Science%20in%20the%20NHS/","title":"Benefits of Data Science in the NHS","text":"<p>Data science can be helpful in solving a number of problems.
