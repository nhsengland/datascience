# Data Science MRes

Each year the Data Science & Applied AI Team offer 8 data and analytics colleagues the opportunity to study for a Master of Research (MRes) in Data Science at Leeds University, supported by the NHS England Data Science & Applied AI Team.

As well as taught modules, a key feature is the  workplace-based research project. These projects are tailored to the student and the emerging policy needs of NHS England. This results in novel insight and innovation to benefit the organisation. Students are supported by the NHS E Data Science team and supervised by academics from Leeds University and Leeds NHS Trust. 

A showcase of some of these projects can be found in these pages.
