Reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) are automated statistical and analytical processes that apply to data analysis. It’s a key part of national strategy and widely used in the civil service. 

Over the past year, we’ve been going through a change programme and adopting RAP in our Data Services directorate. We’re still in the early stages of our journey, but already we’ve accomplished a lot and had some hard-learnt lessons.

This is about analytics and data, but knowledge of RAP isn’t just for those cutting code day-to-day. It’s crucial that senior colleagues understand the levels and benefits of RAP and get involved in promoting this new way of working and planning how we implement it.

 This improves the lives of our data analysts and the quality of our work.
