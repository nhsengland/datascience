    Sean and I have spent the last 15 months on the Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme, which is soon coming to an end. This program consists of 6 months of weekly lectures on a range of data science, operational research, coding, and web development, followed by a 9 month project. Sean and I opted for the project to be a set of proof of concepts using the Waiting List Minimum Dats set (WLMDS) to identify data science techniques that may provide novel insights into this dataset. This blog post is a summary of our project, as well a reflection on the past 15 months.

> Sean and I have spent the last 15 months on the Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme, which is soon coming to an end. This program consists of 6 months of weekly lectures on a range of data science, operational research, coding, and web development, followed by a 9 month project, run by the University of Exeter PenChord team and is available for free for anyone working in public healthcare or policing. Sean and I opted for the project to be a set of proof of concepts using the Waiting List Minimum Dats set (WLMDS) to identify data science techniques that may provide novel insights into this dataset. This blog post is a summary of our project, as well a reflection on the past 15 months of the course. 

*Why did you decide to attend the HSMA programme?*

**Amaia**: Having joined the data science team at the end of my NHS Digital graduate scheme, I'd ended up getting stuck into my projects directly, and focusing on the skills needed for my specific projects, which have been the [Probabilistic Data Linkage <odel](../../our_work/data-linkage-hub/linkage-projects/better-matching.md) and [Developing Artificial Primary Care Records
](../../our_work/swpclab.md) and so I came to the realisation that my wider data science knowledge and formal training was quite lacking, and I wanted to get an insight of a wider range of techniques.

*How did you find the course?*
**Amaia**: Whilst the beginning of the course started quite slow, as it's designed to teach clinicians or other non technical staff how to code in Python, it quickly ramped up and I found myself learning about such a massive range of techniques every single week. I now feel like I have a comprehensive set of notes I can refer to if I'm ever in doubt about which technique is most appropriate, or how to improve a particular model. The project phase I found really challenging, particularly at the beggining, because I really struggled to figure out how to come up with a project that would be impactful, reusable, and allow me to practice as many of my new skills as possible. However, once we found our feet, I really enjoyed being able to apply my skills, and getting that committed time each week to work on it. Dan and Sammi who ran the course are also great, and always willing to help if you got stuck!
