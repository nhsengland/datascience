# How You Can Learn Data Science

Data science isn't just for data scientists! As a profession, we're passionate about sharing these skills and techniques.

For this purpose we've put together a **monthly newsletter** with valuable **insights**, **training opportunities** and **events** for people interested in learning more about the various aspects of data science, further developing their skills, and progressing in their career:

!!! note
        
    The newsletter is targeted towards members of the NHS England Data Science Profession, so some links may only be accessible to those with the necessary login credentials, however the newsletter and its archive are available for all at the link above.

Through [AnalystX] we also support the [NHS Data Science Community](https://data-science-community.analystx.uk/) which is the home of spreading data science knowledge within the NHS.

You can also learn a lot about data science by simply getting to know the wider cross-government/health community:

- [Govt Data Science Community](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/data-science-community)
- [NHS R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/)
- [NHS Pycom](https://nhs-pycom.net/)
- [AnalystX]

These have some overlap, but each has it's own niche, depending on what language or area you want to focus more on (e.g. Python, R, specific use cases).
