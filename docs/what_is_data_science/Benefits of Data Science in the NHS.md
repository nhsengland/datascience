# Benefits of Data Science in the NHS

Data Science can be helpful in [solving a number of problems](./index.md). Specifically, this could lead to benefits such as:

- **better resource planning** (e.g. [improving bed allocation using AI](../our_work/bed-allocation.md))
- **increased responsiveness to demand and seasonal pressures** (e.g. A&E demand prediction)
- **improved data quality** via better data linkage, leading to higher quality analytics and decision making.
- **making existing processes more efficient**, benefitting patients and the public (e.g. [NLP based automation of NHS website review moderation](../our_work/ratings-and-reviews.md))
- **helping our colleagues work more efficiently and get the most out of our existing and new technology** (e.g. [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/))
