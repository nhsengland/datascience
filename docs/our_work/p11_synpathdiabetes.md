summary: Exploration work into incorporating learning into a pathway simulator for diabetes.  This work has fed our current SynPathGo project to create synthetic patient pathways and a foundation for agent based modelling in the NHS.

Using the SynPath framework we created a diabetes simulation for 800 patients.  These patients could interact within a fictional local area with hospitals providing outpatient and inpatient services, GP practices and community healthcare services.

## Results

The project showed how to develop a set of environments, interactions and patients from academic literature, policy, and clinical resources. The model currently runs a simulation that prints outputs of patient records into the console.

Future collaboration around validation and how to apply learning algorithms are being pursued.
