title: Creating a Generic Adversarial Attack for any Synthetic Dataset
summary: Can the privacy of a generated dataset be assessed through downstream adversarial attacks to highlight the risk of re-identification

---

An extensible code was developed to apply a suite of adversarial attacks to synthetically generated single table tabular data in order to assess the likely success of attacks and act as a privacy indicator for the dataset.  Using this information then informs the generation and information governance process to ensure the safety of our data.

## Results

The code-base was successfully developed with code injection points for extensibility.  Unfortunately, as the code could be used as an active attack on a dataset, we have decided not not to make the codebase public but instead aiming to both extend the number of attacks and incorporate the code in our synthetic generation process.
