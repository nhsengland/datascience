_This project is currently live, and as such the following is subject to change._

AI presents transformative opportunities in healthcare, but the technology brings with it risks to people, the natural environment and society at large. NHS England has a responsibility to effectively harness AI to support the provision of better care to all patients.

To do this, data scientists (among others) need to ensure ethical considerations are embedded in the development, evaluation and implementation of AI and data science projects more generally.

However, there are few practical examples of what ethical AI in health looks like for those involved in its design and implementation. This is despite the proliferation of guidance from research institutions and other organisations.

## Ongoing work

We have written a White Paper in which we identify the characteristics of ethical AI that data scientists should be concerned with at the NHS. This takes into account other actors in AI development at the NHS, including cybersecurity, assurance and governance colleagues.

This paper proposes that data scientists specifically focus on trying to ensure four characteristics of AI: fair, transparent, value-adding and reliable.

Our practical suggestions of how we can work towards embedding these characteristics in working practices include:

* trialling tools and frameworks on live and emerging projects and to share learnings with the wider community. This will eventually constitute a portfolio of real examples that can inform future projects.
* coordinating a series of interactive workshops to build awareness of ethical risks, and to create and sustain a shared vocabulary to document and help mitigate these risks effectively along each projectâ€™s lifecycle. Initially this will be based on the [Data Hazards project](https://datahazards.com/).
* developing standardised resources that can be flexible to different types of data science projects, but ensure a minimum level of consideration and proportionate action. This includes a [Model Card](https://github.com/nhsengland/model-card).
* mapping the development processes and involved actors of AI at the NHS and growing a platform to share knowledge and experiences.
