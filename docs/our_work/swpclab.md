Often the problem in the NHS is adoption not innovation, something that the South West Primary Care Lab is trying to combat. The South West Primary Care Lab will be an artificial GP surgery currently being built at a university, for GPs to attend to test out how innovative technology (from hypertension management algorithms to ambient voice technology) could impact their every day life to test out the benefits with no real patients or real clinical outcomes to convince them to implement them in their surgeries, or test whether it's even worth pushing to implement them. This project is being run by the South West Trusts Innovation Team, however, in order for it to be possible they need artificial, high fidelity patient data, which is where we come in!

This project is in very early development, and currently we are working on one specific use case: hypertension. We are creating a hypertension focused, clinical data driven dataset that represents a population of patients with hypertension. We are using the [NICE guidelines](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/NG136) of hypertension management to inform the processes, as well as working together with clinicians involved in the project.
