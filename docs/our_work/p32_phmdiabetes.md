A collaborations with East Suffolk and North Essex foundation trust (ESNEFT) to apply a suite of data science techniques to a large population health data including both primary and secondary care data.  The aim of the project was to identify inequalities in diabetes care whilst making reusable code bases which can now be applied for different conditions and in different organisations.

A small collection of code bases have been created to support the analysis of inequalities in diabetes services for a single locality based on linked population health data.

## Results

The project was able to both deliver new insights around drivers for inequalities as well as reproducible analytical pipelines in the code-bases.  This means the code and approach can be reused for other disease or could be adapted for different localities.
