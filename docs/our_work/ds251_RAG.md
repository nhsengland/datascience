See our RAG Demos and discussions [here](https://github.com/nhsengland/ds_251_RAG)


## Headlines: 
- LLMs produce more relevant and accurate content when given key information in the context window. 
- All RAG techniques seek to utilise this strength of LLMs by maximising the use of the context window. 
- Modern LLM systems will involve many RAG techniques, often coming as standard in AI development architectures.
