**Developing Healthcare Language Model Embedding Spaces**

**Niall Taylor**, **Dan Schofield**, Andrey Kormilitzin, Dan W Joyce, Alejo Nevado-Holgado

*...explore specialized pre-training to adapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are assessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training objective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings...*

**Hypergraphs for Frailty Analysis Research Paper**

**Zoe Hancox**, Samuel D. Relton, Andrew Clegg, Philip G. Conaghan, and **Daniel Schofield**

*Inclusion of mortality to hypergraphs alongside the most prevalent combinations of frailty conditions.  This paper demonstrates that this technique enables us to determine the probability of acquiring another condition as well as understanding the connection and sequencing of acquiring comorbidities.*

**Representing Multimorbid Disease Progressions using directed hypergraphs**

**Jamie Burke**, Ashley Akbari, Rowena Bailey, **Kevin Fasusi**, Ronan A.Lyons, **Jonathan Pearson**, James Rafferty, and **Daniel Schofield**

*To introduce directed hypergraphs as a novel tool for assessing the temporal relationships between coincident diseases,addressing the need for a more accurate
representation of multimorbidity and leveraging the growing availability of electronic healthcare databases and improved computational resources.*

**Large-scale calibration and simulation of COVID-19 epidemiologic scenarios to support healthcare planning**

**Nick Groves-Kirkby**, Ewan Wakeman, Seema Patel, Robert Hinch, Tineke Poot, **Jonathan Pearson**, Lily Tang, Edward Kendall, Ming Tang, Kim Moore, Scott Stevenson, Bryn Mathias, Ilya Feige, Simon Nakach, Laura Stevenson, Paul O'Dwyer, William Probert, Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, Christophe Fraser

*... We adapted an agent-based model of COVID-19 to inform planning and decision-making within a healthcare setting, and created a software framework that automates processes for calibrating the model parameters to health data and allows the model to be run at national population scale on National Health Service (NHS) infrastructure. ... These simulations were used to support operational planning in the NHS in England, and we present the example of the use of these simulations in projecting future clinical demand during the rollout of the national COVID-19 vaccination programme. ...*

**Primary care coding activity related to the use of online consultation systems or remote consulting: an analysis of 53 million peoplesâ€™ health records using OpenSAFELY**

**Martina Fonseca**, Brian MacKenna, Amir Mehrkar, The OpenSAFELY Collaborative, Caroline E Walters, George Hickman, **Jonathan Pearson**, Louis Fisher, Peter Inglesby, Seb Bacon, Simon Davy, William Hulme, Ben Goldacre, Ofra Koffman, Minal Bakhai

*We aimed to explore general practice coding activity associated with the use of online consultation systems in terms of trends, COVID-19 effect, variation and quality.*

**Assessing the value of integrating national longitudinal shopping data into respiratory disease forecasting models**

**Elizabeth Dolan**, James Goulding, Harry Marshall, Gavin Smith, Gavin Ling, Laila Tata

*... We investigated the value of integrating sales of non-prescription medications commonly bought for managing respiratory symptoms, to improve forecasting of weekly registered deaths from respiratory disease at local levels across England, by using over 2 billion transactions logged by a UK high street retailer from March 2016 to March 2020. We report the results from the novel AI explainability variable importance tool Model Class Reliance implemented on the PADRUS model. ...*
