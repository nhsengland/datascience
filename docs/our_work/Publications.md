**Constructing multicancer risk cohorts using national data from medical helplines and secondary care**

*Identification of cohorts at higher risk of cancer can enable earlier diagnosis of the disease, which significantly improves patient outcomes. In this study, we use machine learning to predict cancer diagnosis in the next year. We select nine cancer sites with high incidence of late-stage diagnosis or worsening survival rates, and where there are currently no national screening programmes. We use National Health Service (NHS) data from medical helplines (NHS 111) and secondary care appointments from all hospitals in England. We show that features based on information captured in NHS 111 calls are among the most influential in driving predictions of a future cancer diagnosis. Our predictive models exhibit good discrimination (AUC – 0.78 – SD 0.04), ranging from 0.69 (ovarian cancer) to 0.83 (oesophageal cancer). While our predictive modelling provides patient level risk predictions, our emphasis is on constructing cohorts of patients who may be at risk of cancer rather than individual risk scores. We present an approach of constructing cohorts at higher risk of cancer based on feature importance and considering possible bias in model results. These outputs can be used to develop highly targeted case finding services, which could help increase earlier detection rates and reduce health disparities. This approach is flexible and can be tailored based on the group the intervention targets (i.e. symptomatic or asymptomatic patients) and the data available to those charged with administering the intervention.*

**Medisure: Towards Assuring Machine Learning-Based Medical Image Classifiers Using Mixup Boundary Analysis**

Adam Byfield, **William Poulett**, **Ben Wallace**, Anusha Jose, Shatakshi Tyagi, Smita Shembekar, Adnan Qayyum, Junaid Qadir, Muhammad Bilal

*Machine learning (ML) models are becoming integral in healthcare technologies, necessitating formal assurance methods to ensure their safety, fairness, robustness, and trustworthiness. However, these models are inherently error-prone, posing risks to patient health and potentially causing irreparable harm when deployed in clinics. Traditional software assurance techniques, designed for fixed code, are not directly applicable to ML models, which adapt and learn from curated datasets during training. Thus, there is an urgent need to adapt established software assurance principles such as boundary testing with synthetic data. To bridge this gap and enable objective assessment of ML models in real-world clinical settings, we propose Mix-Up Boundary Analysis (MUBA), a novel technique facilitating the evaluation of image classifiers in terms of prediction fairness. We evaluated MUBA using brain tumour and breast cancer classification tasks and achieved promising results. This research underscores the importance of adapting traditional assurance principles to assess ML models, ultimately enhancing the safety and reliability of healthcare technologies.

**The Use of Online Consultation Systems or Remote Consulting in England Characterized Through the Primary Care Health Records of 53 Million People in the OpenSAFELY Platform: Retrospective Cohort Study**

**Martina Fonseca**, Brian MacKenna,  Amir Mehrkar, The OpenSAFELY Collaborative, Caroline E Walters, George Hickman,  **Jonathan Pearson**,  Louis Fisher,  Peter Inglesby,  Seb Bacon,  Simon Davy, William Hulme,  Ben Goldacre,  Ofra Koffman,  Minal Bakhai

*We aimed to explore general practice coding activity associated with the use of Online Consultations (OC) systems in terms of trends, COVID-19 effect, variation, and quality.  The OpenSAFELY platform was used to query and analyze the in situ electronic health records of suppliers The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) and Egton Medical Information Systems, covering >53 million patients in >6400 practices, mainly in 2019-2020.  We successfully queried general practice coding activity relevant to the use of OC systems, showing increased adoption and key areas of variation during the pandemic at both sociodemographic and clinical levels. The work can be expanded to support monitoring of coding quality and underlying activity. This study suggests that large-scale impact evaluation studies can be implemented within the OpenSAFELY platform, namely looking at patient outcomes.*

**Developing Healthcare Language Model Embedding Spaces**

**Niall Taylor**, **Dan Schofield**, Andrey Kormilitzin, Dan W Joyce, Alejo Nevado-Holgado

*Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle on out-of-domain datasets like healthcare focused text. We explore specialized pre-training to adapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are assessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training objective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings. These schemes are evaluated on downstream document classification tasks for each dataset, with additional analysis of the resultant embedding spaces. Contrastively trained models outperform other approaches on the classification tasks, delivering strong performance from limited labeled data and with fewer model parameter updates required. While metadata-based pre-training does not further improve classifications across the datasets, it yields interesting embedding cluster separability. All domain adapted LLMs outperform their publicly available general base LLM, validating the importance of domain-specialization. This research illustrates efficient approaches to instill healthcare competency in compact LLMs even under tight computational budgets, an essential capability for responsible and sustainable deployment in local healthcare settings. We provide pre-training guidelines for specialized healthcare LLMs, motivate continued inquiry into contrastive objectives, and demonstrates adaptation techniques to align small LLMs with privacy-sensitive medical tasks.*

*... We adapted an agent-based model of COVID-19 to inform planning and decision-making within a healthcare setting, and created a software framework that automates processes for calibrating the model parameters to health data and allows the model to be run at national population scale on National Health Service (NHS) infrastructure. ... These simulations were used to support operational planning in the NHS in England, and we present the example of the use of these simulations in projecting future clinical demand during the rollout of the national COVID-19 vaccination programme. ...*
