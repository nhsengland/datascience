Process Mining is the term given to a family of techniques that have been developed to analyse process flows through the recording of an event log. Process Mining has three main application areas, these are discovery, conformance checking and enhancement. In process discovery, the output is a fact-based process model based on the recorded events in the database. Discovery is the most common process mining investigation, where the discovered process model is often not expected by the supervisor of the process. In conformance checking we measure how well the recorded processes fit a pre-defined process model. Conformance-checking techniques can therefore be used to check whether certain rules and policies are being abided by within an organisation. Finally, enhancement is focused on improving the existing process models by analysing how additional attributes affect the throughput times and frequencies of activities in the process.

For this work we converted ambulance data into an event log and applied process mining techniques using the PM4Py library.  We used the PM2 methodologies to conduct the process mining project.

## Results

Most of the project time was spent designing appropriate business rules to be applied to the data in order to create the event log.   Directly Follows Graphs (DFGs) were then created to represent the highest occuring processes. Conformance techniques were used to measure how well the mined process models fitted the event log data. However, the variation in the treatment activites also casued the mined models to allow events including the call for an ambulance to happen in a sequence counterintuitive to real ambulance job cycles.

A succession of further process mining techniques were then applied to the data. A majority of these involved enriching the data, the iterative process around adding data to the event log to find out more about it. This is especially important with event logs where two processes account for such a high percentage of cases, 99%. With Ambulance service being temporal, of the seven processes in the DFG, all had to happen sequentially. The enrichment of the data, adding in IMD data, but also adding back in some of the original patient level data, allowed for patterns, differences in means, and other explorations of data to take place. Enrichment here meant attaching IMD information to postcodes or areas in the data. It also meant retrieving additional data about each patient, for example, age, sex, ethnicity, and adding that back into the event log alongside the respective ids. The outputs here were analysed to investigate for any patterns within the data. This type of analysis was repeated, and time examined, to see if there were any differences in times of treatment, and across the spectrum of the the events in the job cycle. Boxplots were used to check the distribution against means for each of these enriched variables. Enrichment also meant feature engineering. Transforming variables into either binary, or time of day into categorical, e.g. to morning, afternoon and night.

Lastly machine learning was applied to see if outcomes could be predicted. Please see the report or case study for full details.
