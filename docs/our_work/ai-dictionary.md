[![AI Dictionary](../images/ai-dictionary.png)](https://nhsx.github.io/ai-dictionary)

AI is full of acronyms and a common understanding of technical terms is often lacking.

We decided to create a simple, open source, AI dictionary of terms with a health and care context to help level up those working in the field.

## Results

A front-end website: [https://nhsx.github.io/ai-dictionary](https://nhsx.github.io/ai-dictionary) written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend) with a JSON schema driven database of terms.
