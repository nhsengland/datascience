The Person_ID is a unique patient identifier used by NHS England with the objective of standardising the approach to patient-level data linkage across different data sets.
The Data Linkage team has produced a detailed documentation of the data linkage algorithm used to create the Person_ID, namely the Master Person Service (MPS).
The figure below is an overview of the process. The full documentation is available in [this NHS England site](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service/master-person-service/the-person_id-handbook). The MPS handbook particularly focuses on how this algorithm is applied to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).
