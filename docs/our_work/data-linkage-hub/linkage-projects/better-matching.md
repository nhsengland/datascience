This project aims at developing an alternative data linkage model to [MPS (Master Person Service)](./mps-handbook.md) by creating a [probabilistic linkage model](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cmm/migrated/documents/problinkage.pdf) using the package called  [Splink](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/index.html), which was developed by Ministry of Justice (MoJ) Data Scientists.
