## Why do we want a Community of Practice?
In NHS England data linkage occurs at various stages of the data lifecycle, involving different stakeholders (from data engineers, to analysts) and happening across different platforms. There exist pockets of knowledge and expertise that operate independently of each others.
The Community of Practice wants to support Data Linkage stakeholders in NHS England to share their expertise and best practices with colleagues across the organisation. 
This is also in response to the Data Linkage Survey in which colleagues expressed a clear interest in cultivating a collaboration space.

## Data Linkage Champions Network
