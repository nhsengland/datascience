title: 'Overview - Data Linkage Hub'
summary: 'The data linkage hub encompasses all things data linkage, from documenting the existing state of linkage in NHS England in the Person_ID handbook, to exploring better matching algorithms using probabilistic models and Splink, to creating a Quality Assurance Framework for Data Linkage.'

Data Linkage is a business-critical process within many government organisations, including NHS England. Being able to link patients across their care journey, making sure that underrepresented populations are not lost in the cracks, and ensuring compatibility when using several data sets for the same purpose is a pillar of why the Data Linkage Enhancement team exists. 

The role of the Data Linkage hub in NHS England includes:

- identifying points of collaboration with other government departments 
- mapping the stakeholders involved in data linkage - both internal and external
- feeding user needs into an overall Data Linkage vision

### [Quality Assurance Framework](./linkage-projects/qaf.md)
If we want to achieve a consistent and high quality approach to linking data, which allows for robust, transparent and auditable results, we also need a framework to operate within. Hence, this workstream aims at creating, testing and implementing in the business process a Quality Assurance Framework for Data Linkage.

### [Better Matching Algorithm](./linkage-projects/better-matching.md)
We're currently working on implementing a [probabilistic linkage model](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cmm/migrated/documents/problinkage.pdf) using [Splink](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/index.html), in order to improve linkage outcomes, and by extension, patient outcomes. 

### [Community of Practice](./linkage-projects/cop.md)
We are creating and leading a community of practice to help people do the best linkage they can, with support from the data linkage team, but also from fellow analysts who are actively working on data linkage. Any internal staff wanting to join the community of practice can go [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A7AGd-QLqWT3CEPP2MGz_Zf7o4_aWQvIK2DoqjJm6L-01%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=4fc6024c-60fe-4723-8aff-3d139f37b1ef&tenantId=37c354b2-85b0-47f5-b222-07b48d774ee3).

### [MPS Documentation](./linkage-projects/mps-handbook.md)
We have been [documenting how the Person_ID is generated via the Master Person Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service/master-person-service/the-person_id-handbook), to make the current process of linking data in the NHS more transparent and easy to understand.
