## The Problem
It is estimated that around 4.6 million people in the UK are living with diagnosed diabetes.

Within the diabetes population, about 25% to 30% experience retinopathy, while around 5% have advanced or vision-threatening forms.

If you have diabetes and you're aged 12 or over, you'll get a letter every 2 years asking you to have diabetic eye screening. (If you have gestational diabetes, which is often a temporary condition, you will not be invited for diabetic eye screening). If the early stages of retinopathy is found, the patient will be invited to screening every 1 year.

Around 93% of people in NWL attended their screening in the last 27 months.

This blanket screening results in millions of GP appointments annually, placing significant strain on healthcare resources

## Our Solution
This project is research based. The Data Science team are using some statistical/economical/data science/ML techniques to find these risk factors. If anything substantial is found, it could be used as a basis for further research, a report and could influence an updated screening policy. 

## Results
The project is a WIP and so we don't have any results to share at this time.
