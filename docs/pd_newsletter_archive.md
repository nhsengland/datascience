# Professional Development Newsletter Archive

The Professional Development function team within NHSE Data Science publish a monthly newsletter highlighting different professional development opportunities available to members of the team. They are hosted on the (internal) [NHSDigital Github](https://jubilant-funicular-p88eyor.pages.github.io/){target="_blank} which has somewhat restricted access. We have put PDF copies of the newsletter here, available for download. The PDF version does lose some of the HTML styling but all links are fully functional.
