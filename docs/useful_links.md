# Useful Links

This is a list, mostly copied from [RAP guidance pages](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/useful_links/) and shows a range of resources throughout the Government and other areas. Let us know if you have any links to useful information, resources or guides that could be added to the list.

## Strategic

- The [Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis) proposes 185 recommendations for secure, broad, ethical health data analysis in UK for research and improved care.

## Guidance, Standards and Best Practice

- The [AQUA book of analytical standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government).
- The [ONS best practice team](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) have a useful website - often called the Quack book covering many of the same topics we cover here. Their best-practice checklist is particularly useful.
- [The Government Analysis Functions website](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/) contains a lot of best practice guides such as on plotting colours, accessibility and standards for ethnicity data.

### Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) and Best Practice

- The NHS England Data Science & Applied AI Team have [created an in-depth resource](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/) in best practice and on how to accomplish Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) that is well worth a look.
- [RAP guidance pages useful links page](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/useful_links/) which includes links to policy and other documentation that supports the adoption of RAP
- [How to implement RAP](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/implementing_RAP/rap-readiness/) and training resources in [Git, Python and R](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/intro-to-git/).

### The Turing Way

The [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html#) have also produced a vast range of resources including guides on:

- [Reproducible research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research)
- [Project Design](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-design)
- [Communication](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/communication)
- [Ethical research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethical-research)

### Causal Inference

[The Causal Inference Interest Group (CIIG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/causal-inference) hosts monthly seminars which discuss recent advances in the field of causal inference, from both empirical and formal perspectives. Everyone with an interest in discussing causal inference is very welcome to come along. Causal inference applies robust methodology in order to answer the questions "How can we distinguish causation from correlation, and in turn find out how one thing influences another?"

## Tools and NHS England Shared Code

### The NHS England Secure Data Environment (NHSE SDE)

- The [NHSE SDE](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/secure-data-environment-service) is the preferred platform and associated service through which researchers get access to English national level data to preform health research. It is part of the [NHS Research SDE Network](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/data-saves-lives/accessing-data-for-research-and-analysis/work-in-progress/).
- Some NHSE Data Scientists function as Data Wranglers for the NHSE SDE service creating research ready datasets, resources, tools and visualisations to allow users to understand the data more easily and facilitate their research.

### NHS England / Digital Github

- The [NHS Digital](https://github.com/NHSDigital) and [NHS England](https://github.com/nhsengland) Githubs contain code shared from NHS Digital and NHS England projects. Well worth a look. 

## Community Spaces

There are several slack channels that discuss RAP and related topics: the [govdatascience.slack.com](https://govdatascience.slack.com) RAP channel, the NHS-R community, and the NHS-pycom community. 

We have an MS Teams page (internal to NHS England).
